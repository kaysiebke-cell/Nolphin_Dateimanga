 * nolphin-cad.h: native 3D/CAD file recognition and metadata (§29)
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free: STL is parsed directly from its
 * documented binary/ASCII layout, STEP from its plain-text HEADER;
 * section, and FCStd (a ZIP container) via libgsf, which the project
 * already depends on. None of this reads actual 3D geometry - there is
 * no CAD kernel (e.g. OpenCASCADE) or FreeCAD available on this system
 * (verified during the accompanying analysis), so no geometric preview
 * is possible yet. See docs/NOLPHIN_SPEC.md §29 for the staged plan.

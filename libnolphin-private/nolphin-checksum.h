 * nolphin-checksum.h: file checksum computation, §39
 *
 * MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-512 via GChecksum (read the file in chunks
 * through GIO, so it works for any GVFS backend, not just local
 * files). BLAKE2 via the system's b2sum, since GChecksum doesn't
 * support it - this one needs a local path and fails cleanly with
 * NOLPHIN_CHECKSUM_ERROR_TOOL_NOT_FOUND if b2sum isn't installed, or
 * NOLPHIN_CHECKSUM_ERROR_REMOTE_FILE for a non-local GFile.

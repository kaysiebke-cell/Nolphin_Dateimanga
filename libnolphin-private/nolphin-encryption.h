 * nolphin-encryption.h: gpg-based file encryption, §39
 *
 * Symmetric (passphrase-based) encryption via the system's gpg -
 * no key management, matching the common "encrypt this file with a
 * password" file-manager workflow. The passphrase is fed to gpg
 * through its stdin pipe (--passphrase-fd 0), never as a command-
 * line argument, so it never appears in `ps`/process listings.
